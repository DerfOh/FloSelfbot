# FloSelfbot
Floretta's selfbot anyone can use.

Floretta's discord server: https://discord.gg/pPxa93F

## Current features

1. Embeds!
2. MultiGame!
3. Other... uh... stuff!

## Installing
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Moonlington/FloSelfbot/releases) and download the latest version of the selfbot. It is recommended to put it in a seperate folder all alone (Don't worry, it makes friends fast.)

## Running
### Windows
Unrar and run the .exe, simple :D
### OSX and Linux
Bit trickier, after unrar-ing you have to open terminal and then do `chmod +x <path to FloSelfbot_OSX/FloSelfbot_LINUX>` it should then create an executable you can double click! (Not tested on Linux yet, bit experimental)

## Updating
Replace the old executable with the new one (and do all that jazz above), simple enough right?
