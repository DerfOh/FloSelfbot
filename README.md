# FloSelfbot
Floretta's selfbot anyone can use

## Installing
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Moonlington/FloSelfbot/releases) and download the latest version of the selfbot. It is recommended to put it in a seperate folder all alone (Don't worry, it makes friends fast.) After that just run the .exe file and it'll run you through the installation process.
