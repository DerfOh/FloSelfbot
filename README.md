## Current features

1. Full embed functionality!
2. Embed creator! (see wiki for instructions)
3. MultiGame!
4. Quoting!
5. AFK Handling!
6. Other... uh... stuff!

## Installing
Head over to the [releases](https://github.com/Moonlington/FloSelfbot/releases) and download the latest version of the selfbot. It is recommended to put it in a seperate folder all alone (Don't worry, it makes friends fast.)

## Running
### Windows
Unrar and run the .exe, simple :D
### OSX and Linux
Bit trickier, after unrar-ing you have to open terminal and then do `chmod +x <path to FloSelfbot_OSX/FloSelfbot_LINUX>` it should then create an executable you can double click/run by doing `./FloSelfbot_OSX/FloSelfbot_LINUX`!

## Updating
Replace the old executable with the new one (and do all that jazz above), simple enough right?
